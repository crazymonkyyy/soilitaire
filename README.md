todo

* make the help image ... not be a quick image edit with unaligned elements
* clean up drawing.mix
* rewrite game.d, its just piles of if statements to handle bugs as I noticed them; to say nothing that I didnt even think of the "fake cards" or "draw" input during planing
* delete zone, it feels to oo-y and was a mistake
*   write up blog on how "machines" was a dead end
* reactive scaling/layout
* combine colorswap and settings into some new project the cleanly handles thier overlap
* replace zenity for the lesser oses
* double check if undo machine is correct, there were bugs that I couldnt explain that Im not sure I could blame on game.d being a mess
* spend an hour on game.d attempting rewrite without zone
*   either factor out hard coded info or rewrite it

realistic todo:

* make fast stack skip to the lowest card
* disable raylibs standard esc and replace it with a menu?
* download more themes
* reconsider sound effects choices?
*
