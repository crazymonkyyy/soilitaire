* make end game animations
* make the help image ... not be a quick image edit with unaligned elements
* clean up drawing.mix
* rewrite game.d, its just piles of if statements to handle bugs as I noticed them; to say nothing that I didnt even think of the "fake cards" or "draw" input during planing
* reactive scaling
* combine colorswap and settings into some new project the cleanly handles thier overlap
* figure out a better system to have duck typing of base types, impliment it in machines.d, undo the hacks of the float/bool interactions
