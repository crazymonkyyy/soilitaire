* make end game animations
* make the help image ... not be a quick image edit with unaligned elements
* clean up drawing.mix
* rewrite game.d, its just piles of if statements to handle bugs as I noticed them; to say nothing that I didnt even think of the "fake cards" or "draw" input during planing
* delete zone, it feels to oo-y and was a mistake
* reactive scaling/layout
* combine colorswap and settings into some new project the cleanly handles thier overlap
* figure out a better system to have duck typing of base types, impliment it in machines.d, undo the hacks of the float/bool interactions
* maybe replace zenity for the lesser oses
* draw pile should have a non shortcut trigger
* double check if undo machine is correct, there were bugs that I couldnt explain that Im not sure I could blame on game.d being a mess
